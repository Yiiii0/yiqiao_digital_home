      "en": "Attended CES 2026 (Jan 6-9). Noticed that successful projects focus on dominating a specific niche, listening closely to users and market feedback, then rolling out 'light' versions for broader audiences. The LVCC halls felt similar, but seeing so many robots actually working was pretty impressive. Also saw lots of healthcare-focused products. Met interesting ideas and people at the Venetian startup pavilion.",
      "zh": "1.6-1.9参加了CES 2026，发现做得好的项目都是抓住一个小的细分赛道打穿，专注用户与市场反馈，然后做\"light\"版本推给大众用户。LVCC的展馆大同小异，但看到很多正在\"干活\"的机器人还是挺震撼的，以及不少healthcare主题的产品。威尼斯人的创业馆里遇到了很多有意思的ideas和人。"

      "en": "After coming to CMU in the second half of the year, I fell into deep confusion and felt lost—couldn't find a clear direction or purpose. Later realized that the fulfillment from working hard in the summer wasn't about achieving results or finding a clear path, but about doing things amid uncertainty and growing through the process. Perhaps I'll never find that 'main thread,' and seeking an optimal answer was just wishful thinking. For the new year: communicate more, do more, learn from great people, work in the right environment, get quick feedback, adjust fast, and be honest with myself.",
      "zh": "今年下半年来到CMU后陷入了很深的迷茫和无力感，找不到人生的主线和方向。后来才反应过来，暑期做事的充实感并非来自完成结果后的喜悦或找到清晰的主线，而是在不确定中不断做事，在过程中充实自己。或许永远也找不到所谓的主线，不过是企图寻找最优解的妄念。新的一年：多交流，多做事，和厉害的人学习，在对的环境做事，及时反馈，快速调整，对自己诚实。"

In the AI era, while machines can process vast information and execute complex tasks, critical thinking and logical reasoning become even more valuable—these are uniquely human strengths and our most important capabilities when collaborating with AI.",
