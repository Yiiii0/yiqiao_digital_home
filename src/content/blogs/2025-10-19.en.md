# OpenAI's Vertical Integration: Strategy or Defense?

**Disclaimer: These thoughts emerged after watching Sam Altman's interview on vertical integration. As an observer navigating uncertainty, my perspectives may be incomplete. I welcome discussion and alternative views.**

## The Question

**How should we interpret Sam's stance on "vertical integration"? Where is the boundary between independent product companies and the "vertically integrated giants" he describes?**

After watching the original interview, here are my reflections.

## The Narrative: Choosing What Future to Believe

Sam Altman himself admits: "I used to be against vertical integration. I was wrong."

The same story can be told from countless angles. What matters most is the narrative you choose to believe. I think OpenAI and Sam believe that **AI is not a product—it's a new factor of production.**

But here's a massive assumption: **Does AI's value creation really require this degree of integration?**

### From Software Company to "Energy Company"

Intuitively, this looks like OpenAI transforming from a software company into an "energy company for the AI era." From chips to electricity, from models to applications—attempting to control the entire value chain.

Consider the recent circular investments:
- NVIDIA invests in OpenAI
- OpenAI buys Oracle's cloud
- Oracle buys NVIDIA's chips

It resembles financial round-tripping. **$1 trillion in investments, $4.5 billion in revenue**—a ratio absurd enough to evoke tulip mania.

### Integration as Strength or Weakness?

Sam's statement about "needing support from the entire industry" suggests a counterintuitive possibility:

**Vertical integration might signal weakness, not strength.**

When you must do everything yourself, it's either because markets are failing or your requirements are too unique.

### The Real Intent Behind Energy Strategy

Sam's repeated emphasis on energy might not be about today. Perhaps he sees a future others haven't glimpsed yet:

**When everyone can train large models, when model advantages diminish, whoever has the cheapest training/inference costs wins.**

Yet the data tells another story:
- Market share dropped from 50% to 34% in 6 months
- 95% of users unwilling to pay
- Burning tens of billions annually

This feels more like **defensive positioning**—when model advantages fade, the only option is controlling the supply chain to build new moats.

Alternatively, he's betting on finding a way for AI to create value far exceeding its costs before the money runs out. Not today's ChatGPT, but breakthrough model capabilities in the next 1-2 years.

## On the Boundary Between Independents and Giants

The assumption is that such a boundary exists. I'm not certain. But I believe:

**An independent product company's real value and moat determine whether larger players can easily replicate it.**

However, I must admit: I don't know what constitutes a real moat for application-layer companies in the AI era.

### When Will AI Become a Commodity?

A critical question: **When will AI commoditize?**

From electricity to the internet, all went through this process. But Sam might see something different. He suggests:

**Models will continuously evolve. There will never be a "good enough" moment.**

If true, AI will never fully commoditize. It will always require frontier research and massive investment. In that case, vertical integration isn't temporary—it's permanent.

### What Is Sam Betting On?

My guess: Sam is betting on a huge assumption—**intelligence is infinitely scalable, and the returns from scaling intelligence are also infinite.**

This assumption might be right. Or wrong.

But here's the paradox: **If intelligence is truly infinitely scalable, the first player to reach a certain threshold might maintain a permanent lead.**

In that scenario, everyone else's investments are wasted. This might explain today's massive AI bubble—not because people are confident they'll win, but because **they can't afford to lose**.

### Where Are the Opportunities for Independents?

Assuming OpenAI wants to become the "Windows/electricity infrastructure of the AI era," and that models don't equal applications—history shows platforms struggle to excel at applications simultaneously.

This leaves room for independent companies:

1. **Vertical domain depth** - OpenAI can't understand every industry's nuances
2. **Neglected long-tail needs** - Not every problem requires 100-billion-parameter models
3. **Localization and compliance** - The tension between global models and local requirements

Alternatively, bet that this entire game will fail. Solve problems that don't need AGI. Serve scenarios where 100-billion-parameter models will never be economical.

## The Greatest Uncertainty

What we all don't know: **What will future models actually deliver?**

A better ChatGPT? Or the ability to "cure cancer" or provide "personalized tutoring for everyone"?

This answer, perhaps no one knows.

Whether vertical integration is right or wrong—only the future will tell. Signals we can watch:

- Will GPT-6 really deliver a 10x improvement? 
- Will enterprise market share continue declining or stabilize? 
- How will the energy/chip projects actually progress?

## Final Reflections

The uncertainty that began in the internet era has amplified today.

In this uncertainty, **excessive certainty (whether bullish or bearish) is dangerous.**

Staying humble, continuously learning, and embracing uncertainty might be more important than picking sides.

After all, history teaches us that truly world-changing innovations often come from unexpected places.
